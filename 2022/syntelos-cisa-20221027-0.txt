class, identity, symbol, & abstraction
The design of datacode languages follows the datacode principle.  Trivial to parse.  


This design program is a minimalism.  Minimal syntactic classes.  Minimal semantic complexity.  Limited grammatical recursion.  By constraining syntactic and semantic freedom to symbolic logic, problem solution freedom is maximized.


The datacode artifact retains archival value by syntactic minimalism.  The datacode machinery retains representational value by semantic minimalism.  Meticulous abstraction maps identity to class.
