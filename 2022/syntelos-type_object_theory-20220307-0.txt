Syntelos Type-Object Theory

  A maturation of type theory develops the distinction of
  logical and mechanical types.  The mechanical hardware
  establishes a binary bit, string of bits, and references
  and operators to perform work on information in a logical
  mechanical spacetime.

  Logically, the type is an abstraction of the object.  The
  type is the fundamental abstraction, the establishment.
  The object derives from type a conception of properties
  and attributes which are realized by a mechanical context
  of syntax and semantics.

  The type context establishes an object context.  A type
  defines an object, so that an object may define an
  application information domain.

  The type has textual and binary forms.  Type I/O includes
  a hexidecimal encoding of a binary form.

  The type must be differentiated from the object.  The
  object form has no particular textual representation
  beyond a "syntelos data-code text" convention that
  requires groups (quotes, brackets, and parentheses) to be
  coupled or paired as to span enclosures, and a common
  syntactic atom that includes references and literals.

  The object has a binary form which pairs the type and
  object into an atomic couple, an ubiquitous molecule.  The
  type-object couple is the structural feature that is
  elemental to lists and lists of lists, including maps.
